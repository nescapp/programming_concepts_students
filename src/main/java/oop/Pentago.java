 * A class that represents a game of Pentago.

 *
 * Pentago is a two-player game on a 6x6 grid board composed of four
 * 3x3 subparts that can be rotated left or right. The board looks
 * like this:
 *
 * ------------------------------
 * |  x   x   x  |  x   x   x   |
 * |  x   x   x  |  x   x   x   |
 * |  x   x   x  |  x   x   x   |
 * ------------------------------
 * |  x   x   x  |  x   x   x   |
 * |  x   x   x  |  x   x   x   |
 * |  x   x   x  |  x   x   x   |
 * ------------------------------
 *
 * with the four subparts being:
 *
 * --------------------------------
 * |              |               |
 * |   TOP_LEFT   |   TOP_RIGHT   |
 * |              |               |
 * -------------------------------
 * |              |               |
 * | BOTTOM_LEFT  | BOTTOM_RIGHT  |
 * |              |               |
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * Two players A and B take turns. Each turn is composed of 2 successive actions:
 * 1) the player places one of his token on the board in a free position, then
 * 2) the player rotates by 90Â° or -90Â° one subpart of the board of his choice.
 *
 * A player wins when he has 5 consecutive own tokens in a row, a
 * column, or a diagonal.
 *
 * Your task is to model the game, by implementing:
 * 1) the main method "play()" that registers the move of the player, and
 * 2) the helper methods "rotateMatrix()", "checkWinPlayerVector()" and "checkWinPlayer()".
 *
 * The 3 helper methods are supposed to help you build the code for
 * the "play()" method.  Therefore, you should implement the helper
 * methods first. The helper methods are graded separately.
 *
 * We also provide the "isGridFilled()" helper method that can be
 * useful in your "play()" method.
 *
 * Do not modify the enumerations, the method signatures, or the
 * instance variables. Even if this is not required to succeed this
 * quiz, you can possibly add new methods and import Java classes.
